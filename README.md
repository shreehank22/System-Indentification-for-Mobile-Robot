# System Identification for Mobile Robot

This repository contains MATLAB and Simulink-based implementation of a **data-driven control strategy** for a mobile robot. A linear state-space model of a nonlinear robotic system is identified using **Subspace State-Space System Identification (N4SID)** from acceleration and control input data. The identified model is then used for designing and tuning a PID controller, ensuring stable and optimal closed-loop performance.

##  Key Features

*  **System Identification** using the N4SID algorithm
*  **Data-driven modeling** from acceleration and control input signals
*  **PID Controller Design** using the Ziegler-Nichols method
*  **Validation through Simulation** using MATLAB/Simulink
*  Demonstrates effective **linear control of nonlinear system dynamics**

##  Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** Acceleration and control input data from a mobile robot are used as the basis for identification.

2. **System Identification:**

   * Employed the **N4SID algorithm** to estimate a discrete-time linear state-space model.
   * Extracted system matrices (A, B, C, D) to represent the dynamics.

3. **Controller Design:**

   * Designed and tuned a **PID controller** using the **Ziegler-Nichols** tuning method.
   * Ensured closed-loop stability and performance based on time-domain metrics.

4. **Simulation and Validation:**

   * Simulated the control strategy in **Simulink** (`Final_prob.slx`).
   * Demonstrated the efficacy of model-based control through step response and error tracking.
